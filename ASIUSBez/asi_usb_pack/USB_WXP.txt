How To Get ASI USB To Work on Windows XP
----------------------------------------

1.  If there is a file named EZUSBW2K.PNF on your computer, delete it, 
unplug your MS-2000 from the USB port, and restart the computer.  

2. If there is a file named EZUSBW2K.INF on your computer, delete it.

3.  Copy EZUSBWXP.INF to the directory that contains .INF files, usually 
C:\Windows\inf.

4. Ensure that EZUSB.SYS is in the directory that contains .SYS files, 
usually C:\Windows\system32\drivers.

5.  Shut down the computer, ensure that DIP switches 4 & 5 on your MS-2000 
are in the down position, connect the USB cable, and turn on the computer.  
The Windows Plug and Play system will automatically find the "New 
Hardware" and display a dialog.  Select the "Search for a suitable 
driver..." option.  Windows will configure itself, and the system should 
work correctly after that.
